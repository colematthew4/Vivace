A mobile score writer that enables composers and song-writers to document tunes and melodies using their instruments as the paper and pencil.

Vivace is currently in the very early stages of development.

## Premise

The main idea of Vivace is to enable composers to write down melodies without ever needing a pencil and paper. Lots of composers already use other score writers like [Finale](https://www.finalemusic.com/), [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius-ultimate), [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en), and many others. But almost all of them require a computer or midi keyboard and an already developed idea for melodies to actually start being productive and writing music. Vivace enables composers to get started with writing a score around a melody simply by playing their instrument of choice. Vivace will automatically take the sound from the instrument and translate it to sheet music, and it will be available to you wherever you are. On the road and don't have a full computer to write down scores? Simply pull out your phone and start recording, and when you get home it'll be there on your desktop to continue.
